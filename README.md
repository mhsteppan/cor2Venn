# cor2venn

This package visualizes a correlation matrix as a Venn diagram. The overlap of circles represents the shared variance (R squared) between variables. Using additional features (e.g. cor2dist) the distance between two variables is proportionate to their correlation (close = positive correlation; distant = negative correlation).
